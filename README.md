### March Madness Machine Learning
#### Project Introduction 
The goal of the project is to predict the result for March Madness by using statistical learning method.   \
The data comes from https://www.kaggle.com/c/ncaam-march-mania-2021/data.   

#### Feature engineering
This process starts from simple version. Then, I add more dimensions to provide more information for model training. 

#### Model Applied 
In this project, I apply logistic regression to do the model training. The final prediction is to show the probability for each team wins.
